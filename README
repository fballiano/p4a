-- P4A - PHP For Applications. --
---------------------------------

------------------
-- Installation --
------------------

Just extract the archive under your web server
DOCUMENT_ROOT (es:/home/httpd/htdocs).

You should rename the directory
"p4a-version" to "p4a".

Open your web browser and go to:

	http://localhost/p4a/

you will now see the list of sample applications
distribuited with p4a.

There are three samples included:
	- sample_en
	- sample_it
	- products_catalogue

sample_en and sample_it are the same application in english
and italian, these applications are very simple and do not
make use of databases.

products_catalogue is a very simple example of virtual catalogue
for shops. To have this application runnning take a look at
applications/products_catalogue/README

We've also included a schema model image (db_schema.png) and the
DBDesigner source for that (db_schema.xml), so you can better
understand what that db does.

--------------------------
- ADVANCED INSTALLATION --
--------------------------

If you want to have p4a installed out of your document root, this will help
you. We use the debian standard way, extract the framework and put it in

/usr/share/p4a

edit your Apache's httpd.conf and add this lines:

Alias /p4a /usr/share/p4a
<Directory /usr/share/p4a>
 Order allow,deny
 Allow from all
</Directory>

-------------------
-- Documentation --
-------------------

All p4a documentation is in "/docs"
directory under p4a installation.

P4A has very few documentation, actually we need p4a running with many
features so we've to develop, develop and develop.

It would be great if you would help in decumenting p4a!!

------------------------------------
-- P4A compatibility: Server Side --
------------------------------------

Linux/Windows
Apache 1.3.x/2.0.x
php/mod_php 4.3.x/4.4.x/5.0.x

------------------------------------
-- P4A compatibility: Client Side --
------------------------------------

P4A works with all browsers that supports XHTML
and JavaScript (the main script is so simple
that there should not be problems with no browser.

The default theme instead uses CSS2 and some
more complex Javascript, so here you have the
tested browsers:

-----------------------------------------
-- P4A compatibility: Workstation Side --
-----------------------------------------

Tested browsers:
- Mozilla Firefox 1.x
- Internet Explorer 5.5, 6.0
- Safari 1.x
- Opera 7.x, 8.x
- Konqueror 3.x

These browsers should work as well:
- all gecko browsers (Netscape 7.x/8.x, Epiphany, Galeon)
- all Javascript 1.2/CSS browser

------------------------------------
-- P4A compatibility: Mobile Side --
------------------------------------

- Pocket Internet Explorer for Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003
- Opera 6.x/7.x

-------------------
-- General Notes --
-------------------

P4A automatically disable magic_quotes_runtime
and magic_quotes_sybase, setting their value to the
PHP default.

There are few other PHP setting that we cannot modify at
runtime, thus we wrote a small htaccess you should use
in your applications. You can find this htaccess in the
main p4a dir, with .htaccess name.

You can't switch between two application with the same
P4A_APPLICATION_NAME under the same virtual host
without closing the browser.
