-- P4A - PHP For Applications. --
---------------------------------

------------------
-- Installation --
------------------

Just extract the archive under your web server
DOCUMENT_ROOT (es:/home/httpd/htdocs).

You should rename the directory
"p4a-version" to "p4a".

Open your web browser and go to:

	http://localhost/p4a/

you will now see the list of sample applications
distribuited with p4a.

There are three samples included:
	- sample_en
	- sample_it
	- products_catalogue

sample_en and sample_it are the same application in english
and italian, these applications are very simple and do not
make use of databases.

products_catalogue is a very simple example of virtual catalogue
for shops. To have this application runnning take a look at
applications/products_catalogue/README

We've also included a schema model image (db_schema.png) and the
DBDesigner source for that (db_schema.xml), so you can better
understand what that db does.

In the application directory you should have seen another project:

	mysql_manager

mysql_manager is a big project for creating an automatic application wizard.
Simply connect mysql_manager to your existing database and you will have
a perfectly running web application to manage it.
mysql_manager is very different from phpMyAdmin, because phpMyAdmin has been
created primarily to view and modify the database structure, mysql_manager
instead is done to allow developers have an application to use to insert
data into the database without having to write a line of code!
In a far (we hope not so much :)) future we hope that mysql_manager could
become an alternative to Microsoft Access, for the ease of use and the power
of developing we applications without programming knowledge.

mysql_manager understand relations between tables, so you will automagically
see combo box where a field is relationated to another and so on.

mysql_manager will let you modify your web application with a simple
POINT AND CLICK grafic interface. Click on "EDIT" menu item and start
playing around. All modifies are saved to XML files.

mysql_manager EDIT system works only on Mozilla browsers.

mysql_manager, as p4a, has a big PEAR integration, so primary keys are managed
trought sequences. You sould have no AUTOINCREMENT primary keys in your table
structure, simple INTEGER fields will correctly work.

--------------------------
- ADVANCED INSTALLATION --
--------------------------

If you want to have p4a installed out of your document root, this will help
you. We use the debian standard way, extract the framework and put it in

/usr/share/p4a

edit your Apache's httpd.conf and add this lines:

Alias /p4a/icons /usr/share/p4a/icons
Alias /p4a/themes /usr/share/p4a/themes
<Directory /usr/share/p4a>
 Order allow,deny
 Allow from all
</Directory>

-------------------
-- Documentation --
-------------------

All p4a documentation is in "/docs"
directory under p4a installation.

P4A has very few documentation, actually we need p4a running with many
features so we've to develop, develop and develop.

It would be great if you would help in decumenting p4a!!

------------------------------------
-- P4A compatibility: Server Side --
------------------------------------

Linux/Windows
Apache 1.3.x/2.0.x
php/mod_php 4.3.x

-----------------------------------------
-- P4A compatibility: Workstation Side --
-----------------------------------------

Gecko browsers (Mozilla 1.x, Netscape 6.x/7.x)
Internet Explorer 5.x/6.x
Safari 1.x (testers needed!!)
Opera 6.x, 7.x (testers needed!!)
Konqueror 3.x
Any JavaScript 1.2 browser with css/css2 support

------------------------------------
-- P4A compatibility: Mobile Side --
------------------------------------

Pocket Internet Explorer for Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003
Opera 6.x/7.x

-------------------
-- General Notes --
-------------------

P4A automatically disable magic_quotes_runtime
and magic_quotes_sybase, setting their value to the
PHP default.
magic_quotes_gpc must be Off (PHP default).

You can't switch between two application with the same
P4A_APPLICATION_NAME under the same virtual host
without closing the browser.

--------------------
-- Notes on Opera --
--------------------

P4A default theme does not seem to be fully
compatible with Opera 6.x, because of the heavy
CSS2 utilization.

P4A default menu ("drop_down")
will not run on Opera 6.x, but only on Opera 7.x.
If Opera 7.x cannot be installed than use differt menu
style such as "tabbed" or "tabbed_rounded".
