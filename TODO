-- IMPORTANT THINGS --
----------------------

- do something with file upload on FCKEditor, we cannot pass the server path within request, we should have the possibility to import only current p4a settings...
- replace smarty with something that's more simple and lightweight
- P4A_DB_Source without orders clause can't work well, add default order on pk if none is supplied?
- use P4A_Table->cols->setVisible and deprecate P4A_Table->setVisibleCols
- check konqueror/handheld for new image/file field type compatibility
- check P4A_Field::getAsRadio and clean it (remove sheet, maybe use div)
- check the new P4A_Menu and clean it (position is used/useful? parent is used/useful?)
- remove navigator/mysql_manager related css from screen.css
- take a look at toolbars and decide what to do with enable/disable buttons in the getasstring, after that we've to anify all toolbars
- change alt/title on table template for next/prev/first/last page (ask for translations)
- take a deep look at MySQL Manager and add many functionalities (eg: frames/fieldset)
- check app change in the same browser window

----------------
-- FAR FUTURE --
----------------

- add and test rich_textarea spell check
- make toolbars work well with handhelds (if handheld render toolbar as buttons hiding unuseful buttons?)
- migrate to I18Nv2? (suspended because of the iconv dependence)
- find standard libraries to format/unformat dates
- change template engine to flexy?
