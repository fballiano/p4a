-- IMPORTANT THINGS --
----------------------

- check the new P4A_Menu and clean it (position is used/useful? parent is used/useful?)
- remove navigator/mysql_manager related css from screen.css
- take a look at toolbars and decide what to do with enable/disable buttons in the getasstring, after that we've to anify all toolbars
- add asc/desc alt to table template (ask for translations)
- add selected alt to table template (ask for translations)
- change alt/title on table template for next/prev/first/last page (ask for translations)
- take a deep look at MySQL Manager and add many functionalities (eg: frames/fieldset)
- continue XHTML output conversion, known issue are:
  - we cannot use "target" for image preview (should we add javascript popup? it is not accessible? with no target we've to hit "back")
  - html code in rich_textarea is not allowed, what to do?
- check session data for deleting smarty if possible
- check app change in the same browser window

----------------
-- FAR FUTURE --
----------------

- add and test rich_textarea spell check
- make toolbars work well with handhelds (if handheld render toolbar as buttons hiding unuseful buttons?)
- migrate to I18Nv2? (suspended because of the iconv dependence)
- find standard libraries to format/unformat dates
- change template engine to flexy?
