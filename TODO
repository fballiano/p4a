- "Descending"
- "Selected"

-- IMPORTANT THINGS --
----------------------

- check if the p4a_listener object is used, otherwise remove it
- add possibility to have custom made locale files
- check the new P4A_Menu and clean it (position is used/useful? parent is used/useful?) maybe change the addItem, using build?
- do something with file upload on tinyMCE, we cannot pass the server path within request, we should have the possibility to import only current p4a settings...
- P4A_DB_Source without orders clause can't work well, add default order on pk if none is supplied?
- check konqueror/handheld for new image/file field type compatibility
- change alt/title on table template for next/prev/first/last page (ask for translations)
- take a deep look at MySQL Manager and add many functionalities (eg: frames/fieldset)

----------------
-- FAR FUTURE --
----------------

- make toolbars work well with handhelds (if handheld render toolbar as buttons hiding unuseful buttons?)
- migrate to I18Nv2? (suspended because of the iconv dependence)
- find standard libraries to format/unformat dates
